Jenkins keeps all its important data in a special separate directory called the Jenkins home directory. Here, Jenkins stores information about your
build server configuration, your build jobs, build artifacts, user accounts, and other useful information, as well as any plugins you may have installed.
The Jenkins home directory format is backward compatible across versions, so you can freely update or reinstall your Jenkins executable without affecting your
Jenkins home directory.

Configure GIT on windows.
